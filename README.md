First JavaScript project I build from scratch. Check out the live preview [**here**](https://rock-paper-scissors-by-al.netlify.app/#).

Let's be honest: this code is dirtier than the room of a college student. I built this while taking my very first JavaScript course. I jumped into an empty VSCode screen and ended up with this. Of course, way before I knew that we could create variables so we don't have to repeat `document.querySelector('..')` all along the document. I also was kind of scared of expressing functions to reuse them instead of repeating so many lines.

Now I know! And will eventually refactor this in the future. However, for the time being, let's just leave it like this, as it's functional and readable enough. Besides, I coded this completely from scratch, so I guess this is kind of an insight of how my soul looked while learning DOM manipulation for the very first time ðŸ¤£. I promise I'll try it harder in future projects.

Thanks a lot for your time and I hope you have a great day/evening!
